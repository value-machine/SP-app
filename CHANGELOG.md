# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Agent workflow (Cursor)**: Commands `prime`, `plan`, `implement`, `validate`, and `quick-piv` under `.cursor/commands/` for session context, formal PIV cycle, and lightweight PIV
- **Learn skill**: Project skill `.cursor/skills/learn/SKILL.md` to persist lessons into rules/commands; `documentation/DOC_INDEX.md` quick link
- **Structure whitelist**: `.cursor/skills/*/` with `SKILL.md` in `projectStructure.config.cjs`
- **Bug Dashboard Implementation Plan**: Planning documentation in `documentation/jobs/temp_job_bug_dashboard/`

### Changed

- **Doc reference validation**: `scripts/validate-cursor-doc-references.js` also scans `.cursor/skills`; strips fenced code blocks before inline backtick scan; resets regex per file; skips multiline backtick spans
- **Rules**: Architecture and code-style point complexity/refactor workflow to `.cursor/commands/optimize2.md`; file-placement temporary-doc examples use placeholders so examples are not mistaken for real paths
- **Bug Dashboard Implementation Plan**: Environment-tag scope (local dev + experimental + staging + production) and migration-deploy todo

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- **Finish Command Debug Pattern Update**: Clarified requirements for adding debug patterns to `debug.md` when a debugging session results in a fix
  - Patterns must be captured at bug-class level (not incident-specific)
  - Format: Symptom class → Likely cause classes → Discriminator question → First diagnostic move
  - Prefer cross-feature language (race conditions, stale state, config drift, schema mismatch, effect dependency loops)
  - Added pattern quality gate: recognizable from symptoms, falsifiable check, project-agnostic benefit

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **TanStack Query Integration**: Server state management with caching, deduplication, and stale-while-revalidate
  - Query keys: shared keys (user, config) in `src/shared/utils/queryKeys.ts`, feature keys in `features/*/api/keys.ts`
  - QueryClient with 5 min stale / 30 min gc defaults, auth-boundary (cache clear on logout)
  - `useUserProfileQuery` / `useConfigurationQuery` as primary hooks; legacy wrappers kept for backward compatibility
  - Mutations: `useUpdateUserProfile` with invalidation on success
  - Prefetching: `usePrefetch` with `prefetchSetup` on hover over Setup links
  - Lazy loading: HomePage and SetupPage with Suspense fallback (`PageLoadingState`)
  - `QueryErrorBoundary` for route-level error handling
  - Test utilities: `createTestQueryClient`, `createQueryClientWrapper` in `tests/test-utils.tsx`
  - Documentation: `documentation/DOC_TANSTACK_QUERY.md`, ARCHITECTURE.md Server State section

## [0.11.5] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- **Hook Execution Timing**: Moved full test execution from commit-time to push-time for faster local commits
  - Removed `pnpm test:run` from `.husky/pre-commit`
  - Added `.husky/pre-push` to run `pnpm test:run` before any push
  - Keeps CI test execution on push and pull requests unchanged

  - Enforces prerequisite version verification for Node.js, pnpm, and Git before setup can continue
  - Adds careful handoff instructions for required web-interface actions the assistant cannot complete directly
  - Adds a full verification checklist for lint, format, type check, structure validation, tests, and build
- **Setup Cleanup Completion**: Updated complete-setup command to remove onboarding-only command files when setup wizard is removed
  - Added instruction to delete `.cursor/commands/start.md` after setup-removal completes

## [0.11.3] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

  - Removed contradictory clone guidance and refreshed setup step references

## [0.11.2] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Structure Validation vs ESLint Cache**: Prevented CI-only structure validation failures caused by ESLint cache generation
  - Added `.eslintcache` to default ignore patterns in `project-structure-validator.js`

### Added

### Changed

- **Centralized Button Styling**: Refactored button styling to be fully centralized in theme
  - Removed all `color` props from button usages across the application

    - `variant="contained"` → uses primary color (main actions)
    - `variant="outlined"` → uses white color (secondary actions)
    - `variant="text"` → uses primary color (text buttons)
  - All button styling is now managed in `defaultTheme.ts` - components only specify variant
  - Ensures consistent button styling across the entire application

- **Outlined Button Hover Effect**: Enhanced outlined button with animated gradient slide effect
  - Outlined buttons now have a smooth gradient slide animation on hover (matching contained buttons)
  - Gradient transitions from transparent to white with sliding animation

  - Uses pseudo-element with proper z-index layering to ensure text remains visible
  - Background size optimized so gradient is only visible during transition, not in static states

### Fixed
