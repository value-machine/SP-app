# optimize

## Purpose

Systematically analyze code for optimization opportunities across four levels: Design, Approach, Efficiency, and Complexity. This command ensures fixes happen at the **right level** to avoid wasted work—don't refactor code that should be rewritten, don't optimize code that should be deleted.

**Key Insight:** Fixing at the wrong level wastes effort. A complex function might need a design change (Level 1), not refactoring (Level 4). Always assess all levels before acting.

**SSOT:** `.eslintrc.json` (lines 65-70) is the single source of truth for complexity thresholds.

## Workflow Overview

```
ANALYZE (all 4 levels) → PRESENT OPTIONS → USER CHOOSES → EXECUTE → VERIFY
```

## Core Principles

### Rule of Three (MANDATORY for Extractions)

**Don't extract/abstract until you have 3+ concrete use cases.** Two usages might be coincidental; wait for the third to prove the pattern.

**Why:** Every extraction adds indirection. Can you trace the feature without opening >5 files?

**Exceptions (Rare - document why overriding):**

1. **Architectural Violation:** Code in wrong layer (e.g., business logic in component) → Extract to correct layer even if single-use
2. **Testability Critical:** Function untestable as-is → Extract enables isolated testing
3. **Extreme Complexity:** Cognitive >25 AND cyclomatic >15 AND >150 lines → Extraction improves readability
4. **Level 2 Rewrite Side Effect:** Helper functions emerge naturally from algorithmic rewrite (2A/2B/2C)

**Default:** When in doubt → Follow Rule of Three (use 4E).

### Indirection Red Flags

Signs of too much abstraction (see also: [Over-Engineering Indicators](#over-engineering-indicators)):

- 🚩 **"Util" or "Helper" files growing endlessly** → Should stay inline or be colocated with feature
- 🚩 **Files with 1-2 exported functions** → Extracted too early, consider inlining
- 🚩 **Passthrough functions** → Functions that just call another function with same args
- 🚩 **Abstract base classes with one implementation** → Premature abstraction
- 🚩 **Interfaces with single implementers** → Abstraction without polymorphism
- 🚩 **"Future-proofing" comments** → "Extracted for future flexibility", "In case we need to swap"
- 🚩 **Can't answer "where does X happen?" quickly** → Feature scattered across too many files
- 🚩 **High fan-out (file imports 10+ things)** → Responsibilities scattered
- 🚩 **Wrapper functions that add nothing** → `logError = (msg) => console.error(msg)`
- 🚩 **Two similar functions** → Accept duplication until third proves the pattern

### Over-Engineering Indicators

When NOT to refactor (accept complexity instead):

- Creating files for single-use code (unless [exception](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions) applies)
- Extracting helpers with <3 call sites (violates [Rule of Three](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions))
- Breaking up cohesive functions that do one thing
- High statement count but low cognitive complexity
- Verbose operations inflating metrics (style copying, config objects, DOM manipulation)
- Abstraction layers with single implementations
- "Future-proofing" for requirements that don't exist
- Two similar functions that "could be" abstracted (wait for third use case)

**Remember:** The cure should not be worse than the disease. Prefer inline code over scattered micro-files.

### Complexity Metrics

**SSOT:** `.eslintrc.json` (lines 65-70)

| Metric | Threshold | ESLint Rule |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | ≤ 10 | `complexity` |
| Cognitive Complexity | ≤ 15 | `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity` |
| Nesting Depth | ≤ 4 | `max-depth` |
| Function Length | ≤ 100 lines | `max-lines-per-function` |
| Parameters | ≤ 5 | `max-params` |
| Statements | ≤ 20 | `max-statements` |

## Phase 1: Analysis (All 4 Levels)

Analyze each hotspot through all four levels **before any changes**. This prevents fixing at the wrong level.

### Level 1: Design Review

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Design issues are the most expensive to fix later. Be ruthless and question everything.**

Ask these questions for each code area, using both **zoomed-out** (architectural) and **zoomed-in** (implementation) perspectives:

#### Zoomed-Out Questions (Architectural)

- **Does this code/feature need to exist?**
  - Is it used? Check for dead code with `grep`/`codebase_search`.
  - Could the requirement be eliminated entirely?
  - Is this solving the right problem, or a symptom?

- **Is this in the right layer?**
  - Is UI doing business logic? (Components should be presentation-only)
  - Is business logic in services? (Should be in hooks/services layer)
  - Are concerns properly separated? (Single Responsibility Principle)
  - Should this be a hook, service, or utility?
  - **Note:** Moving code to the correct layer (1C) takes precedence over [Rule of Three](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions). If code is in the wrong layer, extract it even if single-use (document as architectural exception).

- **Is there duplication or scattered logic?**
  - Is the same logic in multiple files? (DRY violation)
  - Are magic values/hardcoded data scattered? (Should be centralized)
  - Is configuration duplicated? (Should be single source of truth)

- **Could this be replaced entirely?**
  - Is there a library/built-in that does this better?
  - Is this reinventing the wheel?
  - Could a platform feature replace custom code?
  - Is this abstraction actually saving code, or adding complexity?

#### Zoomed-In Questions (Implementation)

- **Is the feature scope correct?**
  - Is this over-engineered for the actual need?
  - Are we handling edge cases that never occur?
  - Is there "just in case" code that adds complexity?

- **Are responsibilities mixed?**
  - Does one function/component do multiple unrelated things?
  - Is validation mixed with business logic?
  - Is error handling mixed with happy path?
  - Should this be split into smaller, focused units?

- **Is data flow correct?**
  - Is client-side validation duplicating server-side? (Server should be authoritative)
  - Are we fetching data that's already available?
  - Is state management appropriate? (Local vs global, derived vs stored)

- **Is the API/interface well-designed?**
  - Are there too many parameters? (>5 is a code smell)
  - Are parameters related? (Should be grouped into objects)
  - Is the return type clear and predictable?
  - Would a new developer understand this API?

#### Critical Red Flags

Watch for these design smells that indicate deeper problems:

- **Hardcoded values scattered across files** → Should be in config/database
- **UI components doing API calls** → Should use hooks/services
- **Business logic in components** → Should be in hooks/services
- **Duplicate validation** → Server should be authoritative, client is UX-only
- **No pagination for lists** → Will break at scale
- **Synchronous operations blocking UI** → Should be async/fire-and-forget
- **God functions/objects** → Doing too many things, split responsibilities
- **Feature flags/config in code** → Should be externalized
- **Magic numbers/strings** → Should be named constants

**Possible outcomes:**
- **1A - Delete:** Code is unused or unnecessary
- **1B - Replace with library/built-in:** Better solution exists
- **1C - Simplify scope:** Remove unnecessary edge case handling, split responsibilities, reduce API surface
- **1D - Keep design:** Design is sound, continue to Level 2

**⚠️ Default to skepticism:** If you're not sure, dig deeper. Check if features are actually used, if abstractions save code, if hardcoded values should be configurable.

**Investigation Techniques:**
- Verify usage: `grep -r "functionName\|ComponentName" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"`
- Check dead code: `codebase_search "Where is FeatureName used?"`
- Find hardcoded values: `grep -r "hardcoded\|magic\|12345" src/`
- Count abstraction cost: Lines saved vs lines of abstraction added
- Verify layer placement: Components (UI only) → Hooks (orchestration) → Services (business logic) → Utils (pure functions)

### Level 2: Approach Review

Assuming design is sound, evaluate the algorithmic approach:

- **Is the algorithm appropriate?**
  - O(n²) when O(n log n) exists?
  - Brute force when smarter solution available?
  - Recursive when iterative is simpler?
  - Sequential operations that could be parallelized?
  - Multiple passes over same data when single pass would work?

- **Is the data structure appropriate?**
  - Array when Set/Map would be O(1)?
  - Nested objects when flat structure works?
  - Storing derived data that could be computed?
  - Using wrong data structure for access patterns?
  - Missing indexes for frequent lookups?

- **Are there unnecessary abstractions? (Indirection Check)**
  - **Apply [Rule of Three](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions):** Don't abstract until you have 3+ concrete use cases
  - Over-abstracted for flexibility never used?
  - Indirection that adds overhead without benefit? (See [Indirection Red Flags](#indirection-red-flags))
  - Patterns used for pattern's sake?
  - Abstraction layers with single implementation?
  - "Future-proofing" for requirements that don't exist?
  - Passthrough functions that just call another function with same args?
  - Wrapper functions that add nothing (e.g., `logError = (msg) => console.error(msg)`)?
  - Can't answer "where does X happen?" without opening 5+ files?

- **Is the control flow appropriate?**
  - Complex state machines when simple conditionals work?
  - Callback hell when async/await would be clearer?
  - Event-driven when direct calls are simpler?
  - Polling when webhooks/streaming available?

**Investigation Techniques:**
- Count nested loops (O(n²) vs O(n))
- Check access patterns (frequent lookups → Map/Set)
- Count abstraction implementations (if only 1, premature)
- Trace feature end-to-end (if >5 files, too much indirection)

**Possible outcomes:**
- **2A - Rewrite with different algorithm:** Fundamental approach is wrong
- **2B - Change data structure:** Right algorithm, wrong data organization
- **2C - Remove abstractions:** Simplify by removing unnecessary layers
- **2D - Keep approach:** Approach is sound, continue to Level 3

### Level 3: Efficiency Review

Assuming approach is sound, evaluate runtime efficiency:

**React/Frontend Performance:**
- Missing `useMemo`/`useCallback` causing re-renders?
- Unnecessary re-renders from unstable references?
- Large component trees re-rendering unnecessarily?
- Missing React.memo on expensive child components?

**Data Fetching:**
- N+1 query problems?
- Missing caching strategies?
- Duplicate API calls?
- Fetching more data than needed?

**Memory & Resources:**
- Missing cleanup in useEffect?
- Event listener leaks?
- Large objects retained unnecessarily?
- Subscriptions not unsubscribed?

**Bundle & Loading:**
- Large dependencies that could be smaller?
- Missing code splitting opportunities?
- Unused imports increasing bundle size?

**Possible outcomes:**
- **3A - Add memoization/caching:** Performance fix without structural change
- **3B - Fix data fetching pattern:** Query optimization
- **3C - Fix resource cleanup:** Memory leak fixes
- **3D - Optimize bundle:** Code splitting, tree shaking
- **3E - Keep as-is:** Efficiency is acceptable, continue to Level 4

### Level 4: Complexity Review

Assuming efficiency is acceptable, evaluate structural complexity.

**Run ESLint complexity analysis:**
```bash
pnpm lint
```

**Check metrics against [Complexity Metrics](#complexity-metrics) thresholds.**

**Structural issues to identify:**
- High cyclomatic complexity (many branches)
- Deep nesting (pyramid of doom)
- Long functions/methods
- Long parameter lists
- God objects (too many responsibilities)

**Coupling issues:**
- High fan-in (many files depend on this)
- High fan-out (depends on many files)
- Circular dependencies

#### ⚠️ Proportionality Gate (BEFORE suggesting extraction)

**Don't optimize for metrics—optimize for maintainability.**

**Proportionality Check Questions:**

| Question | If NO → Default to 4E |
|----------|----------------------|
| Does this code have 3+ existing call sites? | <3 uses → keep inline ([Rule of Three](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions)) OR check [exceptions](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions) |
| Would extracted helpers be reusable elsewhere? | Non-reusable → keep inline |
| Is cognitive complexity high (not just statement count)? | High statements + low cognitive = acceptable |
| Would a new developer understand it better after extraction? | Same/worse readability → keep together |
| Is the function doing multiple unrelated things? | Cohesive function → keep together |
| Can you trace the feature without opening >5 files? | Too scattered → don't add more indirection |

**Common cases where 4E (Accept) is correct:**
- High statement count from verbose but necessary operations (style copying, DOM manipulation, config objects)
- Single-purpose utility used in one place
- Function is cohesive and readable despite exceeding thresholds
- Extraction would create files with only 1-2 private helpers
- Two similar functions that "could be abstracted" but aren't proven to need it yet (wait for third)

**Possible outcomes:**
- **4A - Extract methods/functions:** Break down large functions *(only if ≥3 call sites OR [exception](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions) applies)*
- **4B - Simplify conditionals:** Guard clauses, polymorphism
- **4C - Reduce coupling:** Extract interfaces, dependency injection
- **4D - Introduce parameter object:** Reduce parameter count
- **4E - Accept complexity:** Complexity is justified; document why:
  - `[cohesive]` Function does one thing well, just verbosely
  - `[single-use]` Code is used in one place, extraction adds indirection
  - `[readable]` Current structure is clear despite metrics
  - `[verbose-ops]` High statement count from necessary verbose operations

## Phase 2: Hotspot Identification

### Combine with Git Churn

```bash
# Files changed frequently in last 30 days
git log --since="30 days ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

### Deep Investigation Checklist

Before analyzing a hotspot, gather comprehensive context:

**Usage Analysis:**
- [ ] Search for all imports/usages: `grep -r "functionName\|ComponentName" src/`
- [ ] Check if feature is actually used in production (not just defined)
- [ ] Verify if "dead code" is actually dead or just rarely used
- [ ] Check if feature is behind a feature flag that's never enabled

**Dependency Analysis:**
- [ ] Count files that import this code (`grep` for imports)
- [ ] Check if high fan-in indicates this is a critical dependency
- [ ] Check if high fan-out indicates this is doing too much
- [ ] Look for circular dependencies

**Complexity Analysis:**
- [ ] Run ESLint complexity check: `pnpm lint | grep -i complexity`
- [ ] Count actual branches/conditions (not just lines)
- [ ] Identify deeply nested code blocks
- [ ] Check parameter count and if they're related

**Design Pattern Analysis:**
- [ ] Is this a "god object/function" doing multiple unrelated things?
- [ ] Is business logic mixed with presentation?
- [ ] Are there hardcoded values that should be configurable?
- [ ] Is validation duplicated (client + server)?
- [ ] Is error handling scattered or centralized?

**Performance Analysis:**
- [ ] Check for N+1 queries (multiple sequential API calls)
- [ ] Look for missing memoization in React components
- [ ] Check if large data structures are recreated unnecessarily
- [ ] Verify if expensive operations are cached

### Priority Scoring

```
Priority = (Level of Issue × 4) + (Churn × 2) + (Dependencies × 1)

Level weights:
- Level 1 issue (Design): 4 points
- Level 2 issue (Approach): 3 points
- Level 3 issue (Efficiency): 2 points
- Level 4 issue (Complexity): 1 point
```

Higher-level issues get priority because fixing them may eliminate lower-level issues.

**Additional Priority Factors:**
- High churn (>10 commits/month) suggests problematic code
- High dependencies (>5 files) means changes have wide impact
- Critical path code (used in hot paths) gets higher priority
- User-facing code gets higher priority than internal utilities

---

## Phase 3: Present Options to User

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Do not proceed without user input.**

For each hotspot, present findings and wait for user decision.

```

### Decision Rules

- If user selects Level 1 option (1A/1B/1C): Skip lower levels—they become irrelevant
- If user selects Level 2 option (2A/2B/2C): Skip Level 4—rewrite will address structure
- Options can be combined when they're independent (e.g., "3A 4B" for memoization + simplify conditionals)
- User can select "D/E" options to explicitly skip a level

---

## Phase 4: Execute Based on User Choice

### Common Steps for ANY Action

**Before making changes:**
1. **Write tests for current behavior** ⚠️ **MANDATORY** (see [Testing Requirements](#testing-requirements-by-action-type))
2. **Create performance baseline** (if applicable for efficiency fixes)

**After making changes:**
1. Verify tests pass
2. Verify performance improvement (if applicable)
3. Run linter: `pnpm lint` - fix any issues
4. Run type check: Ensure TypeScript compiles
5. Run architecture checks (if extracting code):
   - Folder structure: `pnpm validate:structure`
   - Import boundaries: `pnpm lint:arch`
6. Re-analyze complexity: Verify metrics improved (if refactoring)
7. Manual verification: Quick smoke test of affected features

### Action Type: DELETE (1A)

1. Verify code is truly unused (search for references)
2. Document what was removed and why
3. Remove code
4. Run tests to verify no breakage
5. Commit: `refactor: remove unused [feature/code]`

### Action Type: REPLACE (1B)

1. Identify replacement library/built-in
2. Implement replacement
3. Remove old implementation
4. Commit: `refactor: replace [old] with [new]`

### Action Type: REWRITE (2A/2B/2C)

1. Document expected inputs/outputs
2. Implement new approach
   - **Note:** If the rewrite naturally requires extracting helper functions (even with <3 call sites), this is acceptable as a "Level 2 rewrite side effect" [exception](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions). Document in commit message.
3. Remove old implementation
4. Run complexity analysis on new code
5. Commit: `refactor: rewrite [function] using [new approach]`

### Action Type: OPTIMIZE (3A/3B/3C/3D)

1. **Create performance baseline:**
   - React: Note re-render count before
   - Queries: Note query count/time before
   - Bundle: Note size before
2. Implement optimization
3. **Verify performance improvement**
4. Commit: `perf: [optimization description]`

### Action Type: REFACTOR (4A/4B/4C/4D)

1. **Confirm proportionality** (for 4A extractions—MANDATORY):
   - [ ] ≥3 call sites OR [exception](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions) applies (document why)
   - [ ] Extraction improves readability/maintainability
   - [ ] Single responsibility, not creating micro-files
   - [ ] Feature traceable without opening >5 files
   - **If fails:** Use 4E instead
2. Check architecture compliance (see [Phase 5](#phase-5-architecture-compliance-for-refactoring))
3. Execute refactoring (extract methods, simplify conditionals, reduce coupling, parameter objects)
4. Run complexity analysis—verify metrics meet [thresholds](#complexity-metrics)
5. Commit: `refactor: reduce complexity in [file] - [summary]`

---

## Phase 5: Architecture Compliance (For Refactoring)

**⚠️ All code extractions during refactoring MUST comply with architecture rules.**

### Code Placement (Layer Rules)

When extracting code, place in correct layer:
- **Pure calculation/logic?** → Extract to `@/utils/` (no React lifecycle)
- **API/data fetching?** → Extract to `@/services/` (business logic)
- **React lifecycle needed?** → Extract to `@/hooks/` (orchestration layer)
- **UI component?** → Keep in `@/components/` (but extract logic to hooks/services)
- **Never extract from components directly to services** - use hooks as bridge if React state/effects needed

### Path Aliases (REQUIRED)

- **Always use path aliases** (`@/utils/`, `@/services/`, `@/hooks/`) - NEVER relative parent imports (`../`)
- Example: `import { calculatePrice } from '@/utils/pricing'` ✅
- Example: `import { calculatePrice } from '../../utils/pricing'` ❌

### Folder Structure

- **Prefer existing folders** when extracting code
- **If new folder needed:** Update `projectStructure.config.js` FIRST
- **Never create unauthorized folders** - ESLint will error
- **Validate structure:** Run `pnpm validate:structure` to verify folder structure compliance

### Import Direction (Downward Only)

- `pages` → `components` → `hooks` → `services` → `utils` → `types`
- **Never create upward imports** (e.g., hooks cannot import from components)

### Architecture Checklist

- [ ] Code placed in correct layer
- [ ] Path aliases used (`@/` prefix)
- [ ] No upward imports
- [ ] Folder structure whitelist respected
- [ ] Folder structure validated (`pnpm validate:structure`)
- [ ] ESLint architecture rules pass (`pnpm lint:arch`)

## Testing Requirements by Action Type

| Action | Test Requirement |
|--------|------------------|
| Delete (1A) | Verify no test failures after removal |
| Replace (1B) | Tests for behavior before replacement |
| Rewrite (2A/2B/2C) | Tests for behavior (new impl must pass same tests) |
| Optimize (3A-3D) | Tests for behavior + performance baseline |
| Refactor (4A-4D) | Tests for behavior (same tests before/after) |

**Writing Tests Before Changes:**

```
Test File Location: `[path]/__tests__/[filename].test.ts`

Tests must cover:
- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] Error conditions
- [ ] All branches (for complexity refactoring)
```

## Example Sessions

Detailed examples in this section show:
- Example 1: Multi-level optimization (calculatePricing)
- Example 2: When to accept complexity (4E)

## Important Notes

- **Assessment before action:** Always analyze all 4 levels before making changes
- **User decides:** Present options and wait for user input at decision points
- **Higher levels first:** Fixing design/approach issues may eliminate efficiency/complexity issues
- **Architecture compliance:** All extractions must follow [layer rules](#phase-5-architecture-compliance-for-refactoring)
- **Natural overlap:** When complexity IS the efficiency problem, it emerges naturally—user can select options that address both
- **Rule of Three:** See [Core Principles](#rule-of-three-mandatory-for-extractions)
- **Indirection cost:** See [Indirection Red Flags](#indirection-red-flags)
- **Over-engineering:** See [Over-Engineering Indicators](#over-engineering-indicators)
