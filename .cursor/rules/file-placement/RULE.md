# File Placement Validation Rule

## Purpose

Ensures files/folders are created in correct locations per `projectStructure.config.js` and architecture rules.

**BEFORE creating any file/folder**, you MUST:

1. Check `projectStructure.config.js` for allowed locations
2. Validate against `.cursor/rules/architecture/RULE.md`
3. Confirm placement matches whitelist patterns
4. Suggest corrections if invalid

## Validation Process

1. **Check structure**: Run `pnpm validate:structure` or check `projectStructure.config.js`
2. **Determine location** per file type:
   - **Page Component** (`.tsx`) → `src/pages/<PageName>/<PageName>Page.tsx` (prefer named files, NOT `index.tsx`)
   - Component (`.tsx`) → `src/components/common/` or `src/features/*/components/`
   - Hook/Service/Util (`.ts`) → `src/shared/{hooks|services|utils}/` or `src/features/*/{hooks|services}/`
   - Types (`.ts`) → `src/shared/types/`
   - Edge Function → `supabase/functions/<name>/index.ts`
   - Cloud Function → `cloud-functions/<name>/`
   - Feature docs (`.md`) → `src/features/*/README.md` or `src/features/*/docs/*.md`
   - Docs (`.md`) → See Documentation Placement section below
   - Migration (`.sql`) → `supabase/migrations/` or `migrations/`
   - Layout hooks (`.ts`) → `src/shared/hooks/useLayout*.ts`
   - Route guards (`.tsx`) → `src/routes/guards/`
   - Feature context (`.tsx`) → `src/features/*/context/`
   - Feature state slice (`.ts`) → `src/features/*/store/`
   - Validation schema (`.ts`) → `src/features/*/types/*.schema.ts` or `src/shared/utils/validation/`
   - Data transformer (`.ts`) → Consumer's `services/` or `src/shared/utils/transformers/`
   - Agent project skill → `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (one `SKILL.md` per folder per `projectStructure.config.cjs`)
3. **Validate**: Directory exists in config, file pattern allowed, matches whitelist
4. **If invalid**: Identify violation, suggest correct location, explain why, offer to create

## Examples

**Page Component**: `ChatPage.tsx` → `src/pages/chat/ChatPage.tsx` (prefer named files, NOT `src/pages/chat/index.tsx`)
- ✅ CORRECT: `src/pages/files/FilesPage.tsx`
- ❌ WRONG: `src/pages/files/index.tsx` (causes ambiguity in editor tabs)
- ❌ WRONG: `src/pages/index.ts` (barrel files NOT allowed for pages - use direct imports)

**Component**: `UserProfile.tsx` → Check if feature-specific (`src/features/users/components/`) or reusable (`src/components/common/`)
- ⚠️ NOTE: Avoid `src/pages/*/components/` unless page truly has multiple page-specific components

**Root file**: `config.yaml` → Not whitelisted, suggest `documentation/` or update config

**Temp directory**: `temp/` → Not allowed, suggest `.gitignore` or `documentation/temp/`

**Edge function**: `send-email` → Create `supabase/functions/send-email/index.ts`

## Integration

Run `pnpm validate:structure` before creating files. Update `projectStructure.config.js` only for legitimate new structures (with approval).

## Error Prevention

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create files in unallowed locations
- ❌ Create directories not in the whitelist
- ❌ Use file patterns not allowed in that directory
- ❌ Modify `projectStructure.config.js` to accommodate violations
- ❌ Skip validation "because it's just a small file"

**DO**:
- ✅ **ALWAYS check structure BEFORE creating** (this is mandatory, not optional)
- ✅ **STOP and validate** if unsure about placement
- ✅ Suggest correct locations when user requests invalid placement
- ✅ Explain architecture reasoning
- ✅ Update config only for legitimate new structures (with user approval)
- ✅ Reference this rule explicitly when validating placement
- ✅ **Mark temporary files** with `temp_` prefix (see Temporary Files section below)

## Temporary Files

**IMPORTANT:** When creating files that are NOT intended to be permanent project artifacts, use the `temp_` prefix.

### What Qualifies as Temporary

Use `temp_` prefix for:
- 📋 **Planning documents**: Decision summaries, migration checklists, implementation plans
- 🔍 **Investigation notes**: Debug findings, analysis results, research summaries
- 📝 **Draft documentation**: Files created during discussion that may be consolidated later
- 🧪 **Test artifacts**: Temporary test data, mock files, one-off scripts
- 🔄 **Migration helpers**: Files tracking progress that will be deleted after completion

Do NOT use `temp_` prefix for:
- ✅ Permanent documentation (README, architecture docs, feature docs)
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Source code files
- ✅ Migration SQL files (these are permanent)

### Naming Convention

```
temp_<descriptive-name>.<extension>

Examples:
- temp_pages-structure-decisions.md       ← Planning doc
- temp_migration-checklist.md             ← Migration tracker
- temp_debug-findings.md                  ← Investigation notes
- temp_api-response-sample.json           ← Test data
```

### Why This Matters

- Makes it clear which files are safe to delete
- Prevents temporary planning docs from cluttering permanent documentation
- Easy to search/filter: `git ls-files | grep temp_`
- Helps with cleanup: `find . -name "temp_*" -type f`

## Documentation Placement

**CRITICAL:** Documentation files have strict placement rules based on their permanence.

### Temporary Documentation

**Temporary documentation MUST be placed in one of these locations:**

- `documentation/jobs/` - For job/feature-related temporary docs
- `documentation/temp/` - For general temporary docs
- `documentation/jobs/temp_job_<name>/` - For grouped temporary docs

**Examples:**
- ✅ **CORRECT**: `documentation/jobs/temp_job_<name>/ANALYSIS.md`
- ✅ **CORRECT**: `documentation/jobs/<feature-slug>_implementation.md`
- ✅ **CORRECT**: `documentation/temp/<topic>_notes.md`
- ❌ **WRONG:** ad-hoc **bug-analysis.md** (or similar) placed directly in `documentation/` root instead of `documentation/jobs/` or `documentation/temp/`
- ❌ **WRONG:** **MY_NOTES.md** (or similar) at `documentation/` root without **DOC_** prefix for permanent root-level docs

**What qualifies as temporary documentation:**
- 📋 Planning documents (implementation plans, analysis, design decisions)
- 🔍 Investigation notes (bug analysis, debugging findings)
- 📝 Draft documentation created during development
- 🔄 Migration helpers and progress tracking files

### Feature-Local Documentation (Preferred for Feature Work)

When documentation is about a specific feature's behavior, API, flows, or constraints, keep it colocated with the feature:

- `src/features/<feature>/README.md` - Required feature overview and maintenance notes
- `src/features/<feature>/docs/*.md` - Optional deep dives, ADRs, and edge-case guides (explicit user approval required)
- `src/features/<group>/<feature>/README.md` - Same rule for nested features

**Maintenance rule:**
- If feature code changes are staged, stage updates to that feature's `README.md` in the same commit
- Pre-commit enforcement: `pnpm validate:feature-docs:staged`
- Default: do not create new deep docs; prefer code comments/tests unless cross-file knowledge requires a doc

**Use `documentation/` for cross-feature docs only:**
- Global architecture guides
- Multi-feature migration plans
- Temporary planning docs (`documentation/jobs/`, `documentation/temp/`)

### Permanent Documentation (DOC_ Prefix Required)

**CRITICAL: Root-level documentation files in `documentation/` MUST have the `DOC_` prefix.**

This naming convention:
- Enforces explicit approval for permanent documentation
- Makes permanent docs easily identifiable
- Prevents accidental creation of root-level docs
- Is validated by `projectStructure.config.cjs` (hard enforcement)

**Naming convention:**
```
documentation/DOC_<DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>.md

Examples:
- DOC_ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md
- DOC_TESTING_GUIDE.md
- DOC_FEATURE_*.md
```

**What qualifies as permanent documentation:**
- ✅ Architecture documentation (`DOC_ARCHITECTURE_*.md`)
- ✅ Feature documentation (`DOC_FEATURE_*.md`)
- ✅ Project guides (`DOC_ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION.md`, etc.)
- ⚠️ Boilerplate-only docs (e.g. DOC_APP_CONFIG_FILE, DOC_SETUP_*) are removed by complete-setup

**Workflow for permanent documentation:**
1. **STOP** before creating any file directly in `documentation/`
2. **ASK** the user: "Should this be permanent documentation with DOC_ prefix?"
3. **WAIT** for explicit approval
4. **USE** the `DOC_` prefix: `documentation/DOC_<name>.md`

**If unsure, default to temporary placement:**
- When in doubt, create in `documentation/jobs/` or `documentation/temp/`
- User can rename with DOC_ prefix later if it should be permanent
- Better to err on the side of temporary placement
- If uncertain whether a new deep doc is needed, ask the user first and avoid creating it by default

### Subdirectories in Documentation

Subdirectories in `documentation/` (e.g., `documentation/Authentication-main-app/`) are allowed for:
- Reference material and code examples
- Grouped documentation by topic
- Legacy documentation folders

Files within subdirectories do NOT require the DOC_ prefix.

### Why This Matters

- **Hard enforcement**: `projectStructure.config.cjs` only allows `DOC_*.md` at root level
- **Pre-commit validation**: Violations caught before commit via `pnpm validate:structure:staged`
- Makes it easy to identify temporary files for cleanup (`documentation/jobs/`, `documentation/temp/`)
- Prevents cluttering the main documentation folder with temporary files
- Ensures permanent documentation is intentional and approved
- Easy cleanup: `find documentation/jobs -name "temp_*"` or `find documentation/temp`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER Move Files Programmatically

**The AI assistant MUST NEVER move, rename, or relocate files programmatically.**

When files need to be moved or renamed:

1. **DO NOT** use read_file + write + delete_file to move files
2. **DO NOT** attempt to update imports manually after moving files
3. **INSTEAD**, guide the user to perform the move in their IDE:
   - In VS Code/Cursor: Drag the file to the new location, or right-click → "Rename"
   - The IDE will automatically prompt to update all imports
   - This ensures BOTH directions of imports are updated:
     - Imports IN the moved file (what it imports)
     - Imports OF the moved file (other files importing it)

**Why this matters:**
- When AI moves files programmatically, it bypasses the IDE's import updating mechanism
- This breaks imports in BOTH directions, requiring extensive manual fixes
- The IDE's built-in file move handles this automatically

**Correct workflow for file restructuring:**
1. AI describes which files need to move and where
2. User performs the moves in IDE (gets auto-import updates)
3. AI verifies the result and continues with other changes

**Example response when file move is needed:**
```
To restructure this feature, please move the following files in your IDE 
(drag & drop or right-click → Rename). The IDE will update all imports automatically:

1. Move `src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` → `src/features/chat/components/ChatContainer.tsx`
2. Move `src/hooks/useChat.ts` → `src/features/chat/hooks/useChat.ts`

Let me know once you've moved them and I'll continue with the remaining changes.
```

## Workflow

**STOP → CHECK → VALIDATE → CREATE**

Always validate placement before creating. If invalid, suggest correct location per architecture rules.

## Related Files

When updating this rule, also check:
- `scripts/project-structure-validator.js` - Main validator implementation
- `projectStructure.config.js` - Structure configuration file
- `package.json` - Scripts that call the validator (validate:structure)
- `documentation/PROJECT-STRUCTURE-VALIDATION.md` - User documentation
- `architecture.md` - Architecture documentation
- `.cursor/rules/architecture/RULE.md` - Architecture standards and structure

## Related Rules

- `.cursor/rules/architecture/RULE.md` - Architecture standards and structure
- `projectStructure.config.js` - Whitelist of allowed files/folders
- `scripts/project-structure-validator.js` - Validation tool

## SSOT Status
