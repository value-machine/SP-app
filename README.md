- 📏 **ESLint + GTS + Prettier** - Code quality and style enforcement (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#code-quality-tools))
- 🧪 **Vitest** - Fast unit testing framework
- 🏗️ **Strict Architecture** - Enforced folder structure and import rules
- 🔒 **Authentication** - Complete auth flow (login, signup, logout) - requires Supabase
- 📊 **Airtable Integration** - Connect to Airtable as a data source (optional)

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Node.js** 20.x or higher - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** 9.15.4 or higher (recommended) or npm/yarn
  - Install globally: `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Git** - Required for cloning the repository and git hooks
  - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Optional

- **Supabase Account** (optional) - [Sign up here](https://supabase.com) if you want to use authentication and database features
- **Graphviz** (optional) - Required only for generating architecture graph visualizations
  - Install: `choco install graphviz` (Windows with Chocolatey) or [download installer](https://graphviz.org/download/)
  - Only needed if you want to run `pnpm arch:graph` to visualize the architecture
- **Airtable Account** (optional) - [Sign up here](https://airtable.com) if you want to use Airtable as a data source

### Configure Line Endings

**IMPORTANT:** Before starting, configure VS Code/Cursor to use Linux line endings (`\n`). This ensures consistent line endings across all files and prevents linting errors.

#### Editor Configuration (VS Code / Cursor)

**Note:** Cursor uses VS Code settings. Configure the line ending setting in VS Code/Cursor settings:

1. Press `Ctrl + ,` to open Settings
2. Search for `files.eol` or `line ending`
3. Change the setting from `auto` to `\n` (Linux)
   - The setting is: **"Files: Eol"** → Select `\n` from the dropdown

See [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71240918/how-to-set-default-line-endings-in-visual-studio-code) for more details.

#### Git Configuration

Configure Git to preserve LF line endings (the repository already includes `.gitattributes` to enforce this):

```bash
git config core.autocrlf false
```

This prevents Git from converting LF to CRLF on Windows systems.

**Why this matters:** The repository uses LF line endings. Without proper configuration, Git on Windows may convert them to CRLF, causing thousands of Prettier/ESLint errors.

### Linter Setup

This project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting. The linters are already configured and will run automatically.

#### Verify Linter Installation

After running `pnpm install`, verify that the linters work correctly:

```bash
# Check for linting issues
pnpm lint

# Check if code formatting is correct
pnpm format:check
```

#### Common Linter Commands

- `pnpm lint` - Check for code quality issues (ESLint)
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint errors
- `pnpm format` - Format all code with Prettier
- `pnpm format:check` - Check if code is formatted correctly

#### Editor Integration

**Recommended:** Configure VS Code/Cursor to:
- Format on save using Prettier
- Show ESLint errors in real-time
- Install the ESLint and Prettier extensions

**If you see many linting errors after cloning:**
- This is usually due to line ending issues (see [Configure Line Endings](#configure-line-endings) above)
- Run `pnpm format` to auto-fix formatting issues
- Run `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-fix linting issues

### Using Cursor Agent

When using Cursor's AI agent to make commits, you may encounter permission issues. This section explains how to configure Cursor to allow Git commits. To allow the agent to perform Git commits automatically, configure the **Command Allowlist** in Cursor settings.

#### Configure Command Allowlist

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for "Command Allowlist" or "allowlist"
3. Add the following commands to the allowlist:
   - `powershell`
   - `Set-Location`
   - `git diff`
   - `git commit`
   - `cd`
   - `git add`

**Why this is needed:** By default, Cursor's agent runs in a sandboxed environment. Adding these commands to the allowlist allows Git operations to run outside the sandbox, preventing permission errors (like `env.exe: couldn't create signal pipe, Win32 error 5`) when committing.

**Note:** After adding these commands to the allowlist, the Cursor agent can perform Git commits without requiring elevated permissions (`all`), making the workflow smoother.

## Quick Start Guide

This guide uses **Option B (fork + clone)** so your project starts in your own GitHub repo.

### Step 1: Fork this boilerplate

1. Open this repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork**.
3. Create the fork under your account or organization.

### Step 2: Clone your fork and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
pnpm install
```

**Note:** You may see TypeScript type errors in tooling output during setup. Vite still runs the app in development mode.

### Step 3: Set up branch workflow for this repo

Keep `main` as production/stable and use `experimental` as long-lived integration.

```bash
git switch -c experimental
git push -u origin experimental
```

Then configure branch protection in GitHub:
- `main`: require pull requests, require status checks, disallow force pushes
- `experimental` (recommended): require pull requests, require status checks, disallow force pushes

Recommended PR flow:
- Daily work: `feature/*` -> `experimental`
- Release: `experimental` -> `main`

Optional (to pull future boilerplate updates):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TMI-apps/boilerplate-vite-supabase-mui-cursor.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Step 4: Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### Step 5: Configure environment variables

Supabase is optional, but required for authentication.

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Go to **Project Settings -> API**.
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **Publishable Key**.
4. Create a `.env` file in project root:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
```

5. Restart dev server after `.env` changes (`Ctrl+C`, then `pnpm dev`).

Legacy note: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is still accepted for backward compatibility.

### Step 6: Verify app routes

- Home: `http://localhost:5173/`
- Login (when Supabase configured): `http://localhost:5173/login`

### You're ready

Start building features on `feature/*` branches and merge through `experimental` before promoting to `main`.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) above.

### Features

- ✅ **Authentication**: Supabase authentication (when configured)
- ✅ **Airtable Integration**: Connect to Airtable as a data source (when configured)
- ✅ **Theme Customization**: Customize the MUI theme
- ✅ **Frontend Development**: All UI components and features work independently

### Configuring Supabase Later

If you skipped Supabase configuration initially, you can configure it anytime:

1. Create or update your `.env` file with Supabase credentials
2. **Restart your development server** (`Ctrl+C` then `pnpm dev`)


### Troubleshooting

**Supabase connection failing?**
- Verify your credentials are correct (check for typos)
- Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root (not in `src/`)
- Make sure you've restarted the dev server after creating `.env`
- Check that your Supabase project is active and not paused

**Environment variables not working?**
- Vite requires environment variables to start with `VITE_`
- Restart the dev server after changing `.env` file
- Don't commit `.env` to git (it should be in `.gitignore`)

**TypeScript errors during installation or when running `pnpm dev`?**
- TypeScript compilation errors are normal and won't prevent the app from running
- Vite handles TypeScript transpilation on the fly for the dev server
- These errors are typically related to type definitions in node_modules and can be ignored during development

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint (code quality checks)
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix ESLint errors
- `pnpm format` - Format all code with Prettier
- `pnpm format:check` - Check if code is formatted correctly
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage

### Code Quality Tools

This project uses **GTS**, **ESLint**, and **Prettier** together for code quality and formatting:

- **GTS** (Google TypeScript Style) - Provides pre-configured ESLint rules
- **ESLint** - Catches bugs and enforces code quality (with custom architecture rules)
- **Prettier** - Formats code automatically for consistency

**Quick Start:**
- Format code: `pnpm format`
- Check for issues: `pnpm lint`
- Auto-fix issues: `pnpm lint:fix`

**Editor Setup:**
- Configure your editor to format on save using Prettier
- ESLint will provide real-time feedback in your IDE
- See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#code-quality-tools) for detailed documentation

## Architecture

This project follows a strict feature-based architecture. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information about:

- Folder structure
- Code placement rules
- Dependency hierarchy
- Import patterns
- Code quality tools (GTS, ESLint, Prettier)

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature**: Add files in `src/features/[feature-name]/`
2. **Use common components**: Import from `@common/*`
3. **Access shared services**: Import from `@shared/*`
4. **Follow the layer rules**: Components → Hooks → Services
5. **Write tests**: Add tests alongside your code
